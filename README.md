Escrow Contract
Overview
This Solidity smart contract implements a secure and flexible escrow mechanism. It allows two parties, a payer and a payee, to exchange funds under specific conditions. The contract leverages the OpenZeppelin library for enhanced security and functionality.

Key Features

Pausable: The contract can be paused by the owner in case of suspicious activity or emergency situations.

Secure Fund Handling: Funds are securely held within the contract until the specific conditions are met.

Clear State Management: The contract maintains a clear state, transitioning through different stages: Created, Funded, Completed, or Refunded.

Event Logging: Events are emitted to track the progress of the escrow process, providing transparency.

Flexible Funding: The contract can be funded either through direct Ether transfers or by calling the fundEscrow() function.


How to Use

Deploy the Contract:
Deploy the contract to a suitable blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).
Specify the payee address as a parameter during deployment.
example for payee address is 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678

Fund the Escrow:
The payer sends the agreed-upon amount of Ether to the contract's address.
Alternatively, the payer can call the fundEscrow() function and send the Ether directly.

Complete the Escrow:
Once the payee confirms that the transaction is complete, they call the completeEscrow() function.
The funds are then transferred to the payee.

Refund the Escrow:
In case of issues or if the contract is paused, the owner can call the refundEscrow() function to return the funds to the payer.

Security Considerations


OpenZeppelin Library: Leverages well-audited and secure contracts from OpenZeppelin.

Pausable Mechanism: Provides an emergency stop in case of unexpected issues.

Clear State Management: Ensures the correct execution of the escrow process.

Event Logging: Provides transparency and enables monitoring of the contract's behavior.
